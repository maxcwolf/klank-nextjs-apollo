## A Next.js + Apollo GraphQL Mechanical Keyboard Storefront
---

- I'm tired of working in Vue and Apollo, so I'm building something with React/Next and Apollo to further hone my skills in React and GraphQL. :fire:
- I have loved using Storybook to build my applications at work using Component-Driven Development, but that's Vue and I want to use React with Styled-Components... So I will be creating all components using Styled-Components in Storybook.

## Tech
- [React.js]()
- [Next.js]()
- [Apollo GraphQL Client]()
- [Storybook.js]()
- [Jest]()

## How to run
Install dependencies...
```bash
yarn install
```
Run Storybook...
```bash
yarn storybook
```
Run local dev server
```bash
yarn dev
```
